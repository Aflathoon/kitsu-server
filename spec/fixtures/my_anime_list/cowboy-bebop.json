synopsis: "In the year 2071, humanity has colonized several of the planets and moons of the solar system leaving the now uninhabitable surface of planet Earth behind. The Inter Solar System Police attempts to keep peace in the galaxy, aided in part by outlaw bounty hunters, referred to as "Cowboys". The ragtag team aboard the spaceship Bebop are two such individuals.<br><br> Mellow and carefree Spike Spiegel is balanced by his boisterous, pragmatic partner Jet Black as the pair makes a living chasing bounties and collecting rewards. Thrown off course by the addition of new members that they meet in their travels—Ein, a genetically engineered, highly intelligent Welsh Corgi; femme fatale Faye Valentine, an enigmatic trickster with memory loss; and the strange computer whiz kid Edward Wong—the crew embarks on thrilling adventures that unravel each member's dark and mysterious past little by little. <br><br> Well-balanced with high density action and light-hearted comedy, <i>Cowboy Bebop</i> is a space Western classic and an homage to the smooth and improvised music it is named after. <br><br> [Written by MAL Rewrite]",
background: "When <i>Cowboy Bebop</i> first aired in spring of 1998 on TV Tokyo, only 12 of the show's 26 episodes aired. Anime censorship had increased following the big controversies over <i>Evangelion</i>, and most of <i>Bebop</i> was pulled from the air due to violent content. Satelite channel WOWOW picked up the show in the fall of that year and aired the full series uncensored. It wasn't a ratings hit in Japan, but nevertheless was well-liked enough to win Best Male Character (for Spike Spiegel) and Best Voice Actor (for Megumi Hayashibara as Faye Valentine) at the 1999 and 2000 Anime Grand Prix. Its biggest influence has been in America, where it premiered on Adult Swim in 2001 with many reruns since. The show's heavy Western influence struck a chord with American viewers, where it became a "gateway drug" to anime aimed at adult audiences.",
